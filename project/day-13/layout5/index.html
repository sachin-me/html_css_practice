        <h2>Chapter Three: The Great American Game</h2>
        <p>Dear Dairy,</p>
        <p>Grandfather's creaky as his front porch, loads his shortgun beneath the awning, spitton restless for rain, carpenter's chair against the whistling air. Rockig, back and forth, rocking snap shot picture - worth it, just like the movies</p>

        <p>In a perfect world we shouldn't have been allowed to lose sight of what it means to love wholly. I've got a Polaroid hanging on my wall that a friend took of me and my angel.</p>
