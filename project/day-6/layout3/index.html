                <p>These two divs are positioned next to one another using <code>display: inline-block</code></p>

                Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <div class="float-left">
                <p>
                    These two are positioned using <code class="code1">float: left.</code>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="float-left">
                <p>
                    You can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but...
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <div class="width-fifty">
                <p>
                    What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%, right?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="width-fifty">
                <p>
                    Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.
                </p>

        <section>
            <div class="viewport">
                <p>
                    If I do the same thing with floated elements...
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="viewport">
                <p>
                    The two elements are side-by-side just as I intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which, in this case, is the same as the width of the viewport.)
